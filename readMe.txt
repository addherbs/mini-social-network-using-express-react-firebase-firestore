It is a Mini-Twitter like Social Network website

Technologies used:
	a. Express
	b. Firebase, Firestore
	c. React

	
Plan is to make it modular so that I can do some basic dev-ops related stuff with this as well.

Current Phase 1:
	a. Server functions which expose all the API's in folder socialNet-functions
	b. React Client which hosts all the static contents in socialnet-clients
