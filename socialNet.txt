1. Create firebase project
2. Commands in cmd:
	npm install -g firebase-tools
	firebase login
	mkdir socialNet
	cd socialNet
	firebase init
		==> Select functions and install dependencies
		
3. Make sure service account key and permissions are downloaded and linked to the code

4. To test it while developing commands:
	firebase serve						// Local serving and testing of firebase functions
	firebase deploy --only functions	// deploys them on gcp

5. Chnage the databse rules because one can view our database collections from the public firestore api that google provies:
	/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)/documents/screams
	/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)/documents/users
	
	
	the new rule would fix this loophole:
	go to
		1. firebase databse:
		2. Rules => Edit rules
		3. allow read, write: if false;
